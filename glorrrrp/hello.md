# hello

I have the github uploads happening in series not in parallel, as is required by github

JavaScript <a href="https://github.com/scripting/tmp1/blob/main/hello.js">worked</a>. 

I have now added support for .js and .opml -- not complete yet, but the flow is there.

I have an interesting idea how to restructure the code so everything is more modular.
